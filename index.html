         <p class="pb-5">
            The Department of Statistics and Data Science is
            elated to bring you Expectations, a 2-day National
            Level fest to be held at CHRIST (Deemed to be
            University), Central Campus, Hosur Road, Bengaluru,
            Karnataka on 20th and 21st January 2023.
            Expectations is the department’s annual tech fest
            which encourages students who are passionate
            about technology to share their innovative ideas,
            while widening their horizons and knowledge by
            leaps and bounds
            The event intends to promote the use of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
            (FAIR) data while ensuring the fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency
            (FACT) of the algorithms and tools. Hence, Expectations 23' aims to broaden your
            perspective and make you more competent and cognizant individuals
         </p>
         <h1 class="fw-light">HUMAN IN THE LOOP</h1>
         <p class="pb-5">
            The term "Human in the loop" has been
            in vogue for long but its significance has
            reigned supreme in recent years. For the
            unversed, HITL banks on human
            acumen to improve data quality and
            uses core statistics to sample good
            data for humans to label. In certain
            cases, considering the workings of a
            machine, the desired output is not
            reproduced as expected. Hence, human
            intervention impacts the outcome and
            aligns it with the need of the hour.
            As data scientists and statisticians, it is not hard for us to believe that ML models are often
            far from truth. Complete reliance on machines in critical domains like healthcare and
            finance (which can potentially ruin human lives if something goes wrong) is considered
            downright irresponsible. It is advisable for a human to review at least some of the
            predictions; those with low confidence, those out of range, and a random sample for
            quality control.
            “Human in the loop” also has an upper hand when it comes to training scenarios that
            enables the learner to fully experience the activity or process. This helps the learner in
            acquiring the required skill to their fullest potential before putting that to use in the real
            world. It also gives room for learning possible outcomes of any particular event. Learners,
            in this case, will interact with realistic simulations and try to act as they would in a realworld situation.
            Hence, we believe that HITL makes a good case for itself to be an interesting niche theme
            for our department fest this time. We hope you share the same vision and contribute
            enthusiastically in more ways than one!
